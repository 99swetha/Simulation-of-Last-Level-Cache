# Simulation-of-Last-Level-Cache
- Designed and Simulated the Last Level Cache (LLC) for a processor that can be used with up to three other processors in a shared memory configuration.
- The design implements a write allocate policy, uses the MESI protocol for ensuring cache coherence and pseudo-LRU replacement policy.
- Built trace files for exhaustively testing LLC behavior and record statistics.
